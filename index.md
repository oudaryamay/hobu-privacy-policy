## 1. Information We Collect

We collect the following categories of data to operate and improve the
App.

### A. Personal Information

-   **Account Data:** Name, email address, and phone number.
-   **Household Data:** Grocery items, stock levels, shopping lists,
    reminders, and household details.

### B. Device and Usage Information

-   Device model, operating system version, and unique identifiers.
-   App interactions, such as features used and time spent.

### C. Camera Permission

-   We request access to your device's camera solely for the purpose of scanning barcodes and QR codes to identify products. Images captured by the camera are processed locally on your device in real-time and are not stored, recorded, or transmitted to our servers.

### D. Photo/Storage Usage

-   We access your device's photo library only to allow you to select and upload images for your profile, household, or receipts. Files are stored locally.

### E. Notification Data

-   We use local notifications to deliver scheduled tasks and maintenance reminders. No notification data is sent to external servers.

### F. Nearby Interaction Data (Hobu Connect)

To facilitate offline synchronization between family members, we collect and share:
-   **Device Display Name:** A name you choose to identify your device to family members (e.g., "Mom's Phone").
-   **Unique Device Identifier:** A persistent, randomly generated UUID used only to establish and maintain trusted connections between your family's devices.
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use collected information to:

-   Manage user accounts and household collaboration
-   Sync grocery lists and stockroom data across devices
-   Send notifications such as low-stock alerts
-   Improve performance, stability, and feature quality
-   Maintain app security and prevent misuse
-   **Offline Peer-to-Peer Syncing (Hobu Connect):** We use the Google Nearby Connections API to discover and sync data with other devices in your home without an internet connection.

We do **not** sell your personal information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We may share limited information with:

### A. Service Providers

To improve functionality, we use:

-   **Google Play Services**
-   **YouTube API Services** (for tutorial videos)
-   **Google Sign-In**  We use Google Sign-In to authenticate users and securely manage account access. We collect your name, email address, and profile picture from your Google account to create your Hobu profile. This data is used solely for identification and personalization within the App.
-   **Google Drive (Cloud Backups)** If you choose to use the Cloud Backup feature, the App generates a secure backup of your local database and images. This backup file is uploaded directly to your own personal Google Drive account.
    - User Control: You retain full ownership and control of these files.
    - Access: The App only accesses the specific folder created for Hobu backups (Hobu-Backup) and does not read or modify any other files in your Google Drive.
    - Storage: Backup files are stored on Google's servers and are subject to Google's Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

These providers have access only to the data required to perform their
tasks.

### B. Legal and Compliance

We may disclose data when required to comply with legal obligations or
governmental requests.

We do **not** share data with advertisers or external marketing
platforms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Data Retention

We retain data only as long as it is necessary for providing App
functionality or as required by law.
All data is permanently removed once you delete your account.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Data Security

We protect your data using:

-   Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS)
-   Secure server storage

Although we use strong security measures, no method of transmission or
storage is completely secure.

This action cannot be undone.
